# Data Structures

A set has three operations like PolyTreeNode it is an ADT

a node has a parent and children and a value for the node

## initialize ADT

@parent
@children = [] empty array
@value = parent(value) passed in value

ability to add a child to a node that is also a parent

## implement PolyTreeNode

with an array

nil

[1]

[2,3]

have a PolyTreeNode 

1 is parent root node

1 parent is nil

add 2 to 1 children array

2 becomes a parent node also

fulfill all the promises of a PolyTreeNode

or else no good the API that the PolyTreeNode is expecting

# DFS

stack frame 1, left child 2 is now root, 2, right child 4 is now root

stack frame: 1, 2, 4.

4 has no children, so 4.children is an empty array []

# if not found return nil
